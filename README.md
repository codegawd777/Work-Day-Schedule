# <Work Day Scheduler>

## Description

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm).

My motivation was to learn how to apply third party api concepts and functions and expand my understanding of coding.

I built this program to practice diffrent coding syntax and functions and build my understaning of coding. 

Helps the user plan a stand work day hour by hour.

I learned how to link a third party api and create elements using data from that api to create elements that the end user will see to use website.
